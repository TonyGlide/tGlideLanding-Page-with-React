            <h1>Very happy with them</h1>
            <p>In the last few months I have placed 3 orders for clothing from Harley Davidson. They had a really good sale on, 50%-60% off. I don't usually shop there as they are expensive. However the clothing i ordered arrived promptly, was very good quality and fit perfect. I understand why they have high prices, their clothes are very good quality. There website was very easy to use and to order from. Very good experience, particularly after getting screwed by Guinness ( see my other review). My only complaint is that after a few days I went back to order more and, although they still had the clothes listed, a lot of them were out of stock.</p>
